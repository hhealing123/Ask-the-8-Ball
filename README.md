# Project 1: Ask the Magic 8 Ball

## Description
For our project, we hav decided to create an application - The Magic 8 Ball.

The Magic 8 Ball provides the users with answers to the question that the user asks where the answers are pulled from the following answer categories: affirmative answers, negative answers, and neutral answers. The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by variety of javaScript APIs, CSS APIs, Bootstrap, and jQuery.
